The Metaverse Standard is a project dedicated to making the "Metaverse" of Snow Crash and other such cyberpunk novels a
reality. In no way shall it follow or be compatible with Second Life convention. Instead, it shall be better, faster, stronger, et al.


Platforms: All, development begins with Mono-based machines (mac, linux) then branches out from there (see roadmap)


Programs in the Metaverse Standard:
"Metasculptor": dedicated to avatar-related things such as skins, clothing, etc. Features scripting console, as well.
"Metabuilder": SketchUp-like building platform, with scripting ability thrown in for objects.
"Metaviewer": Functionally similar to Firestorm and OpenSim running at the same time. Features a massive overhaul to usability, aesthetics, and performance.

Inter-machine model transfer standard: Same as it is with SecondLife due to the immense speed. However, allowances need to be made for using standard materials instead of wrapped textures.

Machine-to-Metaverse model transfer standard: .dae


Performance Target: 30fps on a low-tier netbook with all graphics settings set to minimum.
Usability Standard: "Pick up and play" similar to, if not better than, Minecraft.
Engine: None. Written directly in C++, although Unreal 4 has some advantages.
